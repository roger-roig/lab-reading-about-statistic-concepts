# Lab | Reading About Statistic Concepts

In the future, you will need to understand deep statistical concepts by reading technical articles. As a training for that, it is interesting to start from here. Also, as we have limited time, this is a way to have some self guided learning to understand everything better and have a wider knowledge.

This week you will find some questions here that you will need to answer by documentating yourself. So you will do a different PR for each question (you are meant to answer the questions in different days). Don't hesitate to write as many text as you need and push images if you need them.

Remember for this lab: there is a right answer. But there is no perfect way to explain it (except for in a mathematical way, but this is another story).

## Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?
You know both concepts but, is there a difference? Are they synonims? Start investigating. 

As a good reference (once you have looked for some information) you have   [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-expected-value-4815bdbd84de) article.

The expected value of a random variable is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment. In other words, the arithmetic mean of the values converges to the expected value as thenumber of repetitions approaches infinity. 

The expected value is also known as the expectation, mathematical expectation, EV, average, mean value, mean, or first moment.

Hence, the mean of the population is the same as the expected value.
